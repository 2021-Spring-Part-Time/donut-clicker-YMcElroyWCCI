            Fred the Baker Baking Company began in 1954 when twin brothers
            George and Fred Weasley created delicious baked goods from the
            basement of a grocery store which was located across the street from
             current location. After brother
            George developed an allergy to flour, Fred and his wife, Jane became
            the sole owners of Fred the Baker Baking Company. In 1957 Fred moved
            the bakery to its current location at 1 North State Street in
            Columbus, Ohio where the delicious baked goods have been enjoyed by
            the citizens of Columbus and its surrounding communities for over
            six decades.

            In 1974, Fred Weasley's son, Fred Weasley II, began working at Fred
            the Baker Baking Company. Enjoying the work, he moved on to
            production and learned the craft of baking specialized in doughnuts.
            Fred Weasley later gave the son the opportunity to purchase the
            bakery when he retired. The son became the second owners of Fred the
            Baker Baking Company in January 1987.

            After 50 years of ownership, Fred Weasley II has decided he is ready
            to retire and wants to keep his love of donuts alive as a game that
            uses button clicks to create virtual donuts for the world to enjoy.
